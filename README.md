# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads Project which is a part of Udacity nanodegree in React and Redux ( Front - end developer ). I joind this degree as one student of FWD scholership.
In this project you will find shelfs and books that can be moved around the shelfs.
use down-right green + sign to add more books.
the Book API is mintained and controled by udacity.

## How to start:

To get started\:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* start the development server with `npm start`.
* enjoy.

```


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
